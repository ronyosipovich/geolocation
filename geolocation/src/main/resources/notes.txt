1) The google api response does not fully serialize into the object because
their json response returns snake cased field names and our java classes use the correct java convention (which is camel case).
It is surprising that google uses snake case for their field names, because it breaks their code standard for json:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml?showone=Property_Name_Format#Property_Name_Format

Since the fully qualified fields that we need (status, location.lat, location.lon) are comprised of single words,
I was able to avoid using Gson TypeAdapters to map the json to java classes.

2) To run:
 a) create a shaded jar using gradle task "gradle shadowJar".
 b) After which, the jar can be run as follows.
 java -jar geolocation-all.jar
 The arguments are: [file path] [SourceName] [SinkName]
 For example, java -jar geolocation-all.jar addresses.txt FileSource StandardOutputJsonSink > result.txt
